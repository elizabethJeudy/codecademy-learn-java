/*
 * In this project, weâ€™ll use Java to write a Mad Libs word game! Mad Libs have short stories with blank spaces that a player can fill in. The result is usually funny (or strange).

Mad Libs require:

A short story with blank spaces (asking for different types of words).
Words from the player to fill in those blanks.
